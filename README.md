# PDS-Lap_simulations
PDS-Lap_simulations contains all files to replicate the simulation study in the PDS-Lap paper.

The PDS-Lap.R file contains the model functions, and the generate_data.R file contains the data simulation functions. All files must be downloaded and stored in the same folder. 

To reproduce the simulation results, the shell file ds.sh needs to be submitted to a supercomputer. The generate_figure.R is provided to generate Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure S1, from the simulation results.
